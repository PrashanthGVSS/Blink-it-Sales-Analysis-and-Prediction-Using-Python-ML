Model Performance Summary:
Linear Regression:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3899.11
R² Score: -0.00
Interpretation: The Linear Regression model performed poorly, as indicated by the R² score close to zero, which suggests that the model is not able to explain any of the variance in the Sales data. The high MSE also shows large prediction errors.
Decision Tree:

MSE: 2380.29
R² Score: 0.39
Interpretation: The Decision Tree model performed better than Linear Regression, explaining about 39% of the variance in sales. However, the MSE is still relatively high, indicating that the model is not highly accurate in predicting sales.
Random Forest:

MSE: 1571.22
R² Score: 0.60
Interpretation: The Random Forest model significantly outperformed both Linear Regression and the Decision Tree, with a much lower MSE and an R² score of 0.60. This means that the Random Forest model can explain 60% of the variance in sales, making it a more reliable model.
Tuned Random Forest:

MSE: 1645.60
R² Score: 0.58
Interpretation: After hyperparameter tuning, the performance of the Random Forest model slightly decreased, with a small increase in MSE and a decrease in the R² score. This suggests that the default Random Forest model was already well-optimized for this dataset, and further tuning did not yield significant improvements.
